# Artist Statement

## Introduction
This project is about personalized health, which will change the way of the medicine. In this project, user will play a role named NABI. He is very weak and always go to see the doctor even play monopoly game. In this program, user will have fun and learn about the personalized medicine (which also called precise medicine). And hopeful, user will think about it and support the research of this topic. Everyone could believe that medical conditions will become much better in the future.

## About this topic
In the past, I did think about Big data and new technologies will change people's lifestyle. Also some companies has already researched and developed the wearable devices on medical areas. However, when I knew about the personalized medicine. I was surprised that our technologies can change the world like that. I read several articles about personalized medicine online and I believed that this theme is significant meaningful. Hence, I want more people learn about this.

## Ideas
* Monopoly - Hospital   

The project will start with an interface looks like a kind of monopoly game. However, when it starts, the scene will change to hospital version of monopoly which means - where ever you go, you have to go to the hospital. I want to use such a game interface to raise users interesting. Then lead them play more.

* Hospital scene   

The scene in the hospital is used to make user start to know the role and topic. The name of the role as well as the picture I drew for the role is used to enrich the character. Which I hope user can get closer with the program. In this scene, user can input their own name, which will be shown in the scene3. Thanks the advice from my tutor Joanne, I believe it was a great idea to make user interact with the program.

* Hidden item game   

The scene3 demonstrates a small game for the user to find hidden items. I want to use this game to connect with the Big Data part. After collecting the precise user health data, personalized medicine can deliver a great result. Also its an advice that as patients, we can provide our medical reports for research and science.

## Design
In my program, I want to provide users a relax environment to enjoy and learn. The program is aim to make users learn about personalized health and development of future medicine. It's a introduction game rather than a normal tutorial.

I like to design some details in my project, so that it looks like an art from Naro. For example, the interface of monopoly game contains my favorite cartoon character Putin (on the jail). Also I changed all the road or street name to medical vocabularies. There is a mobile company while the mobile shows my name. In scene2, the door hangs a sign with 'Dr. not strange'. The scene3, I tend to design a bedroom so that I imitate Vincent's art work. I believe Vincent is the great artist so that I want to pay respect to Vincent.
