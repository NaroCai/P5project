# Statement of Originality

I Xinmeng Cai declare that everything I have submitted in this major
project is entirely my own work, with the following exceptions:

## Inspiration
The beginning of the program looks like a monopoly game. I drew the background learn from monopoly.

## Assets

In scene1, the background picture contains a jail with a rabbit. It is a imitation of a character named Putin in Cartoon Usavich.
In scene3, the background picture I drew is a imitation of <Bedroom in Arles> by Vincent van Gogh.
